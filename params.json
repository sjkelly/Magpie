It provides libraries that make it easy to render hardware and access information about dimensions. Going furthur, it will allow parameterized bill of material generation.\r\n\r\n##How to use!\r\n\r\nYou can use Magpie in your designs by including the \"magpie.scad\" file. This will allow you to get started with all the tools in Magpie. For a while we recommend keeping the Magpie source with your projects, as the interfaces may change. Documentation on the provided modules can be found in \"MODULES.md\".\r\n\r\n##Contributing!\r\n\r\nUse GitHub to fork or send a pull request!\r\n\r\n##Thanks!\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to nophead and nathan7 for inspiration and ideas for this library. Much of the code is derived from their work. \r\n\r\n##Projects using Magpie!\r\n\r\nMagpie is being used in the RepRap Lewis. If you know of any cool projects using Magpie, let us know!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
